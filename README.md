My triangular life:

### Stay with me

I am available and very fast to answer from the following:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/BaharaJr) - I sometimes write code that works
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BaharaJr) - I be tweeting about my long distance girlfriend who lives in the future
* [Email](bennybenester@gmail.com) - Sometimes I read mails from all the spams I subscribed to while still a teenager
